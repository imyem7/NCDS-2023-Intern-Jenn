Jennifer Ye Moon-Chung, August 2023

This internship has provided me with a unique opportunity to delve into the dynamic landscape of data librarianship and engage with a vibrant community of professionals.

## Introduction to NCDS Data Librarian Internship

The NCDS Data Librarian Internship is an immersive program designed to equip aspiring data librarians with hands-on experiences and essential skills. Throughout my internship, I embarked on a transformative journey marked by skill development, collaboration, and meaningful insights into the world of data services.

## Project Outcomes

**1. Utilizing the Power of EDA and Visualizations for Effective Data Exploration**

In this project, I leveraged R Markdown notebooks to delve into the ZooScore dataset. I employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and engaging visualizations to comprehend the dataset's nuances and unearth valuable insights. This outcome reflects my ability to navigate complex datasets, extract meaningful information, and drive data-driven discussions.

The VarNameWizard is a web application I developed to address challenges posed by messy column names in datasets. This tool streamlines the process of converting column names, generating data dictionaries, and validating data integrity. The VarNameWizard reflects my innovation and problem-solving skills, as well as my dedication to enhancing data accessibility and usability.
