Paulsen et al. 2003: E. faecalis is a natural inhabitant of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and is commonly found in soil, sewage, water, and food, frequently through fecal contamination.  I think, but am not sure, that these are naturally foind in humans/commensals that occasionally cause infections.  Low confidence, though.

Mycobacterium avium subsp  Paratuberculosis   ,,3,,3,2,0,3,,VR,42689,0,3,"**low confidence score because several studies have postulated that Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis could be zoonotic, but no actual evidence of animal-to-human transmission.** From Manning and Collins 2001: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the cause of Johne's disease, a usually fatal chronic intensital infection. It primarily affects ruminants (domestic and ""free ranging"") and has been reported in primates, rabbits, stoats, and foxes (carnivores probably were infected via eating infected rabbits). Has a long pre-clinical phase--months to years. It can persist in the environment for up to a year (possibly longer in water) and infects susceptible hosts that ingest it. ""As the infection continues to spread within and among animal populations, the level of M. paratuberculosis also increases in raw foods of animal origin and in the environment. This may provide the opportunity for exposure to animal species, including humans, previously not considered to be possible hosts of M. paratuberculosis."" Authors are concerned that this may be a pathogen on the rise: ""the authors speculate that two global factors may be influencing the ecology of M. paratuberculosis and rising infection prevalence, namely: an increase in number of susceptible hosts and the acidification of the environment. Eradication of M. tuberculosis from humans and M. bovis from animals has possibly left an immunological void (i.e. animals of increased mycobacterial susceptibility) for M. paratuberculosis to occupy. This concept of competitive exclusion was demonstrated for species of Salmonella in poultry in England,Wales and the USA (111).""  In livestock, transmitted via nursing or ingestion of contaiminated food or water (also in utero infection).  Very unlikely that it is sexually transmitted, although the bacteria has been found in semen.  M. avium subsp paratuberculosis is excreted into the milk during later stages of infection (and possibly at other stages).  Disease has spread from livestock to  wildlife.   Discussion of M. avium subsp paratuberculosis as a possible zoonosis: ""Public health issues have been raised about the transmission of M. paratuberculosis from animals to humans through animal products (dairy foods, meat, contaminated surface water) and the potential for  subsequent infection and perhaps disease (32). Crohn's disease, a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease, is thought by some to be  linked to M. paratuberculosis (25). The studies reviewing a simple association between M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease are divergent and inconclusive (22, 61 , 141, 146).""  Isolation of M. paratuberculosis from the blood of patients infected with Crohn's disease has been unsuccessful.  *however* ""Given that [many] mycobacterial pathogens...including the closest relative of M. paratuberculosis (M. avium), are capable of infecting both animals and humans and are classified as zoonotic agents, it is plausible that M. paratuberculosis is also zoonotic.""  Acha also reviews the literature of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis as the cause of Crohn's disease.  The mycobacterium that causes Crohn's evidently has very similar characteristics to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis but has not yet been isolated.  2008 review article (Behr & Kapur 2008) reviews studies about whether Crohn's disease is caused by MAP and concludes that it has yet to be confirmed or refuted.  Has **maybe** been found in people with Crohn's disease via PCR, but the review article had a long disclaimer about how the PCR results might be inaccurate.  Chamberlin et al. 2001 describes the ""mounting evidence"" for MAP being the causal agent of Crohn's.",0,Mycobacterium avium subsp  Paratuberculosis   ,15400,Mycobacterium avium subsp  Paratuberculosis   ,1960,possible cause of Crone's disease.

Yechouron et al. (1992) note that they cannot exclude the possibility that other Mycoplasma species may have been infected at the infected sites, but they believe that the repeated isolation of only M. argini from the blood and respiratory tract imply that M. argini caused the illness (either way, seems extremely likely that this was transmitted from livestock to the worker, so that justifies a score of a 2).  Cannot be sure on transmission method, but very likely via aerosols generated during animal slaughter and processing.

Multiple articles discussing O. dewittei japonica in humans.  Uni et al. 2010 is one of the more recent articles and describes.  This is the sixth case of zoonotic onchocerciasis (all but one from Onchocerca dewittei japonica) in Japan, and they have all occurred (including the described case) where humans, wild boar, and Simulium vectors overlap.  There are also other zoonotic Onchocerca spp.  Anyway, in Japan, Onchocerca dewittei japonica from wild boar was identified as the causative agent in four of the five prior cases.  This case study is a 70-year-old man living in Fuchu City, Hiroshima Prefecture (different place than the last five infections, which were all in Oita, Kyushu) who had a nodule on his left knee that was causing pain.  A femail coiled worm was found in it which was identified to be O. dewittei japonica.  The patient was a farmer who lived in a rural area near mountains inhabited by wild boar.  The patient has not traveled outside of Japan nor visited Oita, Kyushu in many years, and does not have pets.  The prevalence of O. dewittei japonica in wild boar was high in and near Hiroshima Prefecture, with 78% of wild boar found to harbor the filarioid (prevalence is 89%% in Oita and high in other parts of Japan tested, too).  Interesting note!!!  ""In Japan, the habitat of the wild boar (estimated population: several hundred thousands) has recently broadened in the western part of Honshu, Shikoku, and Awaji-shima Island as well as Kyushu, because the annual snowfall has decreased, rice field left unused by migration of segments of the work forces away from rural areas are favorable habitat for wild boar...""",,Onchocerca dewittei japonica     ,95,Onchocerca dewittei japonica     ,17,,"Uni et al., 2010",,VR,42682,,Uni et al. 2010,,

Srihongse & Johnson (1965) tested serum from people in two areas of Panama and found 15 people whose serum had neutralizing antibodies.  From Chowdhary et al. 2012: ""The vertebrate host range has not been defined"" although single isolation of the Macaua virus (in the Wyeomyia serogroup) has been found once in two different rodent spp and the Anhemni virus (also Wyeomyia serogroup) has been found in bird(s) and may indicate a bird reservoir.  Also mention that TUCV (Tucunduba, in Wyeomyia serogroup) was found in a child.  Plenty of experimental mouse infections.

Monkeys may no longer play an important role in the maintenance of the virus and may now, like humans, be accidental hosts.  Virus probably enters humans via mucosa of the upper respiratory tract or through skin abrasians.  People in monkeypox endemic areas each both squirrel and monkey meat, which may be introducing the disease into humans. ""Interhuman transmission from patients to contacts does not play an important role""- time to investigate.  In 2003, 72 people in the U.S. infected after rodents imported from Ghana.  Because it was in the U.S., there is really good CDC coverage of it (but is not included in Acha because it is too recent).  Some good information on it in Fleischauer et al. 2005.  There is definitely interhuman transmission:  Hutin et al. 2001 (citing a book I don't have access to): ""Human-to-human transmission [of monkeypox] occurs with an incubation period of 12 days (range 7-21 days).""  Arita et al. 1985: ""Of 155 cases [of monkeypox], some 80% are believed to have resulted from infection from an as yet unknown animal reservoir; the rest occurred among unvaccinated close contacts among whom a secondary attack rate of 15% was observed.  Although person-to-person spread appears to have occurred in some instances, few cases were observed in the third or fourth generation of transmission and none thereafter"" & ""Some cases occurred within households at intervals which were consistent with person-to-person transmission and a few cases of monkeypox occured in hospitalized children who were not in contact with animals during the presumed incubation period, but who had been in close contact with other human cases...person-to-person spread has been postulated for some 20% of all cases.""  See paper for more information--there has been as many as 4 generations of person-to-person transmission.

Also from Chua et al. 2011: ""It is important to emphasize that among all three outbreaks investigated in Malaysia so far, each was associated with multiple human infections.

However, reovirus is rarely associated with disease, except in the very young [internal citations omitted].  No indication that humans are getting them from animals.

However, these are Pteropine Orthoreovirus, which are not the same as Mammalian Orthoreoviruses.  Melaka virus (which is a Pteropine, not Mammalian, Orthoreovirus) very likely is zoonotic.  Kohl et al. 2012 suggest the zoonotic potential of some mammalian orthoreoviruses found in European bats, but present no evidence of it, just ""considering that reovirus-infected bats were found in close proximity to humans, a possible spill-over and zoonotic potential of bat-borne MRV needs to be discussed"" hence my lower confidence score (and score of 0 vs 2).

Zero indication that humans are getting this from vertebrate reservoirs.  pg 144: ""The source of Paragonimus [not species specific] infection for man and other definitive hosts is freshwater crabs and crayfish containing parasite metacercariae.  Transmission results from the ingestion of raw or undercooked crustaceans, raw crabs marinated in wine, or custacean juices.  Paragonimiasis is a puvlic health problem in countries where it is customary to eat raw crustaceans or use them for supposedly therapeutic purposes."" <--NOT a vertebrate host.  Although, Acha does acknowledge ""It is possible that man may also become infected by eating meat from animals that are paratenic hosts carrying immature parasites, as evidenced by cases on the island of Kyushu, Japan, that occurred following the consumption of raw wild boar meat.  The hypothesis that there are paratenic hosts is reinforced by the fact that paragonims haver been observed in carnivores such as tigers and leopards that do not eat crustaceans.""   ...which would make me score it as a 2-2 or 2-3 (low confidence), but: Acha does note that ""Transmission is always cyclic--the infection cannot be transmitted directly from one definitive host to another.  The parasite must complete its natural cycles, and in order for this to happen the two intermediate hosts [specific spp of snails and crustaceans] must be present...The reservoir of Paragonimus spp. comprises man, domestic animals, and many species of wild animals.  In endemic areas of eastern Asia, the human infection rate is high enough that man can maintain the infection cycle alone through ongoing contamination of freshwater bodies with human feces.  In such areas, the role of animal definitive hosts may be of secondary importance."" So if we are conceding that humans are getting this from vertebrate hosts, there is facilitated human-to-human transmission?  Although, I don't think that P. ohirai is an important enough or common enough parasite, that there is truly human-to-human transmission, because it's not common enough.  !!!note that this is general Paragonimus spp. information, not P. ohirai specific!

Also: ""The environmental and geological characteristics are an ideal environment for sandflies.

Plasmodium brasilianum ,,0,,3,2,3,3,,VR,42670,3,3,"Predominantly in monkeys, but it can be transferred to humans via mosquito bite (has been shown experimentally in lab but likely naturally too, as many people in Brazil have antibodies against P. brasilianum or P. malariae (the spp cannot be differentiated using conventional serology) and P. brasilianum has been found in monkeys and in Anopheles darlingi in the areas where people test positive for P. brasilianum (or P. malariae) antibodies.  According to Ewald 1983, parasitemias in humans infected with P. brasilianum are usually less than 50/mm^3 (vs. ~20,000/mm^3 for P. vivaz and 50,000+/mm^3 for P. falciparum, which suggests that P. brasilianum is not easily transmitted from humans back to mosquitos?  No paper that I read said this definitively, but I am cautiously scoring it a 2, anyway, since it is fairly well-studied (akthough one paper, Baird 2009, classified it as not being a disease in humans, so the uncertainty goes both ways).  P. brasilianum and P. malariae very morphologicaly similar.  Ta et al. claims that P. brasilianum is not naturally transmitted to humans.  HOWEVER probably entered new world monkeys via humans, suggest Collins and Jeffery 2007: ""[P. malariae] is also reported in areas of the Amazon Basin of South America, along with Plasmodium brasilianum, a parasite commonly found in New World monkeys.

Very similar to P. vivax, P. cynomolgi is predominantly found in non-human primates.  From Ewald 1983: ""When P. cynomolgi was transmitted from monkey to man by mosquito, typical manifestations were parasitemias of less than 300/mm3 (and occasionally greater than 1000/mm3 when blood passaged), headaches, and moderate fever that almost never exceeded 40.5?C (26, 74).

However, since P. vivax is a huge problem predominantly outside of Africa (where more people are Duffy antigen positive), this disease can clearly be maintained in people sans non-human vertebrate reservoir.  Not sure what to score it, then.  A 0? Not necessarily the same sp, or possible same spp but different strains? Also from Ramasamy 2014: ""Zoonosis was recently confirmed by sequence analysis of parasite DNA from a Caucasian European traveler, who contracted P. vivax-like malaria while working in the Central African Republic, which showed that the parasite had SNPs characteristic of ape and not human P. vivax [citation].

Retortamonas intestinalis ,,0,,2,1,0,2,,VR,42664,0,1,"Flagged because not necessarily in non-humans, so ""0"" might not be correct.  According to CDC, R. intestinalis is a nonpathogenic flagellate that lives in the gastrointestinal tract (although Kawamura et al. 2001 found it in bile/pancreatic juice).  People acquire it via consumption of contaminated water and food or via hands/formites with infective cycles.  From CDC's diagram, looks like it is maintained sans animal reservoir:  http://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/retortamonas/.  There is a Giardia intestinalis on GIDEON, but not sure why original scorers thought it was the same as R. intestinalis?  Kawamura et al. 2001 describe a case where the infected man lived in an urban area and kept a dog, but had no contact with other domestic animals.  R. intestinalis is usually associated with a warm climate and poor sanitation.  !!!!

Rhodococcus equi ,,0,,1,1,3,3,,VR,42663,3,3,"GIDEON: bacterium, reservoir is farm animals and farm soil.  No vector; vehicle is ""? inhalation, contact, ingestion.""  Often infects immuno compromised patients, like those who are HIV positive.  R. equi is common in soil from areas where pigs, catt, or horses are raised.  Most foals with infection are found to excrete the organism in exhaled air.  R.equi has been reported in camels, pigs, goats, sheep, llama, cats, and dogs, as well as humans and horses.  Weinstock & Brown 2002 review article: First human case was from a man working in a stockyard, cleaning animal pens.  ""Exposure to domesticated animals, such as horses and pigs, may play a role in some cases of infection. R. equi is found in the soil of 50%–95% of farms, and concentrations are high in horse feces. In Oklahoma, which Verville et al. claim has the highest numbers of horses per acre and horses per capita in the United States, 12 cases of R. equi infection were treated during a 6-year period at a single institution. However, only one-third of all patients with R. equi infection have a history of exposure to horses or pigs"" [internal citations omitted]...""Other routes of R. equi acquisition, including human colonization and person-to-person transmission, are poorly understood"" and ""At least 3 nosocomial cases of R. equi have been reported [29], including 1 that occurred in a patient who developed sepsis and hydrocephalus from an infected ventricular shunt 2 weeks after hospitalization. Patient-to-patient transmission was implicated in 2 HIV-infected patients who developed R. equi infections after sharing a room with another HIV-infected patient who had R. equi pneumonia.""  They cite Arlotti et al. 1996 possible human-to-human transmission.  I can't access that article, but it's abtract says ""Presumptive risks of infection (contact with horses or farm dust, or cohabiting with people affected by R. equi infection) were present in more than 50% of patients. This finding, and the frequency of bacteria in the sputum, are not sufficient proof of transmission between humans, but do suggest the need for respiratory isolation of patients affected by R. equi pneumonia.""

Salmonella enterica subsp  arizonae   ,,0,,1,2,2,1,,VR,42663,2,1,"Subspecies of Salmonella enterica (above), so renamed as such.  Mahajan et al. 2003 report a fatal case of Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae in a child.  The child's father was a snake charmer.  S. enterica subsp. arizonae is a common gut inhabitant of reptiles (usually snakes) and rarely infects humans but occasionally infects young infants and immunocompromised individuals with a history of intimate associations with reptiles.  Reptiiles and snakes are the natural reservoirs of S. enterica subsp. arizonae.  Also has caused outbreaks in turkeys and sheep. ""Reptiles are symptomless carriers of this pathogen and are probably infected through contaminated water, feed, or soil. Earlier findings indicate that these bacteria probably exist as commensal flora in the animal gut. Widespread contamination of the home environment and a significant number of cases occur due to pet reptiles.""  No indication of human-to-human transmission in literature although ""A carrier state is not uncommon, and a recurrence of S. enterica subsp. arizonae sepsis in immunocompromised patients after 1 year has been reported""",0,Salmonella enterica subsp  arizonae   ,13300,Salmonella enterica subsp  arizonae   ,44,,Mahajan et al. 2003,,VR,42663,,,,
Salmonella enterica subsp  enterica   ,,0,,1,2,3,2,,VR,42663,3,2,"GIDEON: Many serovars of Salmonella.  Salmonella enterica divided into six subspecies, S. enterica subsp enterica, salamae, arizonae, diarizonae, houtenae, and indica.  Because Salmonella arizonae is in the database, will see if I can limit this to S. enterica subsp enterica if there's enough information.  Using GIDEON's breakdown, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica includes Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, typhimurium, infantis, hadar, choleraesuis, and others.  Hendriksen et al. 2004: pig, calf, and child on farm in Netherlands infectived with Salmonella enterica serovar thyphimurium (which GIDEON classifies as part of subsp. enterica).  The isolates were indistinguishable, suggesting nonfoodborne animal-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission.  Most human cases are foodborne although infection can also occur via contact with animals, contaminated water, or the environment. ""Because the boy had free access to the stables, we assume that he was infected by direct or indirect contact with animals. The boy was not likely to have been infected with this particular DT104A variant by any other route because this is an uncommon phage type. Transmission of Salmonella spp. by direct contact with animals has been reported before (3–9). Close contact with farm animals is a risk factor for S. Typhimurium DT104 infections (8,9).""  However, human-to-human transmission is described as a possibility via touhing after inadequate handwashing, wearing inadequately disinfected footwear, or wearing working clothes indoors.  Stevens et al. 2009 review article: The importance of food-producing animals as reservoirs of non-typhoidal serovars affecting humans is well established.  The pandemic of S. Enteritidis (which GIDEON considers to be a serovar of subsp. enterica) lasting over two decades to the present is primarily associated with poultry meat and eggs.  A UK-wide survey in 2005 indicated that 4% of chicken on retail sale were contaminated with Salmonella.  Serovar Typhimurium is highly prevalent in pig production and poses a threat of zoonotic transmission.  Acha, vol 1, pg. 236: With the exception of S. typhi and that paratyphoid serotypes, which are human-specific, all other infections caused by Salmonella may be considered zoonoses.  This is clearly at least a 2, but trying to determine if there is documented human-to-human transmission...it gets messy because of the nomenclature and the amount of literature out there.  Acha says that convalescent carrier may shed bacteria for several weeks and, sometimes, months.  Acha says there is human-to-human transmission via fecal-oral route, especially in hospitals. Olsen et al. 2001: Outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Schwarzengrund (this is subsp. enterica) in hospital.  Brought back by someone from thei Philippines and infected multiple people in the hospital over several years (bacteria persisted on equipment, mattresses, etc.).  ""This outbreak was unusual because it occurred in medical facilities and involved person-to-person transmission"" So while I can't say that the original infection was acquired zoonotically, this serovar of S. enterica subsp. enterica has human-to-human transmission and others have zoonotic transmission.

Simian adenovirus A     ,,0,,1,2,2,2,,VR,42655,2,3,"Adenovirus is in GIDEON, but not necessarily Simian adenovirus A.  General information is that the reservoirs for (all) Adenovirus are humans and non-primates and the vehicle is droplet and water.  From GIDEON: ""Pneumonia due to a simian strain of Adenovirus (Titi Adenovirus) was reported in 2010, in a human having monkey (Callicebus cupreus) contact.""  This is reported in Chen et al. 2011 and occured at a primate research center. I am not sure if TMAdV (titi monkey adenovirus) is the same as Simian Adenovirus A, since it was thought to be a new strain and species...  Ersching et al. 2010 reports neutralizing antibodies for two simian adenovirus strains (AdC6 and AdC68) in humans, but again, those are probably not Simian adnovirus A (since they have a ""C""...).  Roy et al. 2012: lots of different strains in SAdV-A (called SAdV-#).  However, monkey adenoviruses belonging to SAdV-A and SAdVB, as well as SAdV-18, bear a strong genetic resemblance to HAdV-F (human adenovirus).  Postulate that there may be or have been a cross-species transmission event and cites the two examples of known human infection with Simian adenovirus (but again, the nomenclature makes it hard.  Is SAdV-1 part of SAdV-A??).  I'm going to call this a 2 but with very low confidence because I'm not sure about SAdV-A in particular.",0,Simian adenovirus A     ,56600,Simian adenovirus A     ,598,,"Chen et al., 2011",,VR,42655,,Chen et al. 2011,Roy et al. 2012,

In the U.S. there have been about 60 described cases of S. mansonoides and there have been about 30 cases of S. mansonoides in South America.  Landero et al. 1991: S. mansonoides caused cerebral sparganosis in a 27 year old woman.  Landero et al. 1991 describe S. mansonoides as a zoonosis and describe the lifecycle as ""Definite hosts for the adult worm are cats and dogs.  The eggs, ehd by the adult, pass with the feces and hatch in water, producing coracidia that are consumed by the first intermediate host, a crustacean (genus cyclops), and develop there...When a snake, frog, mouse, or raccoon (second intermediate host) drinks water containing the copepod...the larva penetrates the intestinal wall of the new host and migrates, usually to the muscles or subcutaenous tissues...Human sparganosis occurs when man is the second intermediate host...Although the most common cause of human sparganosis is the ingestion of infected cyclops in water, the eating of raw snakes or frogs or the application of their meat as cataplasms on human wounds seems to be the most prominant source in Asia.""  BUT their sources are not specifically for S. mansonoides.  Chan et al. 1987: Majority of human infections are caused by larvae of the Spirometra mansonoides species.  The adult tapeworms live in the intestines of dogs and cats.  Their eggs pass in the feces and hatch in fresh water, releasing coracidia...humans acquire the infection in several ways, most commonly by drinking contaminated water but ingestion of undercooked meat can cause it.

GIDEON: found in cattle and rarely in fish.  Isolated from human vagina and intestine, and carried on the hands of health-care workers.  Important cause of neonatal septicemia, meningitis, and pneumonia.  Acha: For a long time, streptococci belonging to serogroub B (S. agalactiae) were considered mainly pathogenic for animals.  They are now recognized as one of the major causes of septicemia, pneumonia, and meningitis in human newborns.  ***pg 261, Vol 1: ""Special attention has been given to neonatal sepsis caused by group B streptococci (S. agalactiae).  Research has shown that S. agalactiae colonizes a high percentage of women (7% to 30% or more) in different locations, such as the intestinal tract, the cervicovaginal region, and the upper respiratory tract.  The agent is possibly transferred from the rectal region to the vaginal canal, since most of the bacteria are intestinal.  Infact can become contaminated in utero or during childbirth.  Only a small percentage of neonates (approximately 1%) become infected and fall ill...The principal reservoir of group B streptococci causing neonatal disease is clearly the mother.  The S. agalactiae serotypes isolated from mothers and sick newborns are always the same.  Although S. agalactiae is an agent of bovine mastitis and has also been isolated from other animal species, there is no evidence that the infection is transmitted from animals to man.  In general, human and animal strains differ in some biochemical, metabolic, and serologic properties.  It has been experimentally shown that human strains of S. agalactiae can produce mastitis in bovines [citation].  However, some studies have suggested that a percentage of human infections may have derived from a bovine source [citations] or that there is reciprocal transmission between humans and bovines.  Nonetheless, research findings seem to indicate that if such transmission occurs, its importance is probably limited.  Facklam 2002 discusses how people have tried to limit diseases caused by S. agalactiae in neonatals and those have been the development of vaccines and screening procedures for the presence of S. agalactiae in anal, cervical, or vaginal carriers and subsequent antimicrobial management.  No discussion of limiting contact with livestock.  Keefe 2007:  Human infection is generally acquired from other human sources, although there may be some risk associated with direct exposure to infected animals and their products...although some surface antigens seem to be specific to the cow, Streptococcus agalactiae is now recognized to be part of the normal bacterial flora in the human throat, genitourinary tract, and rectum.

They warn against accidental transmission of S. pneumoniae to animals, suggesting that spillback occurs (http://www.criver.com/files/pdfs/infectious-agents/rm_ld_r_streptococcus_pneumoniae.aspx).

Another article (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf) describes S. pneumoniae as causing disease in humans but also horses.  S. pneumoniae is also a commensal organism in other species, such as guinea pigs and rats.

Viney & Lok 2007 cite two articles that I don't have access to, Pampiglione and Ricciardi 1972 & Hira and Patel 1980 to say that ""S. fuelleborni occurs in African primates where infection can be shared with humans"" and the abstract of Hira & Patel 1980 only says that 138 humans were infected with S. fulleborni, not the origin of the infection (can't access abstract of Pampiglione & Ricciardi et al. 1972). Scaglia et al. 1983 (abstract only) reports finding S. fulleborni in humans in Rwanda. Hira & Patel 1977 report finding S. fulleborni in 9.9% of surveyed strongyloidiasis patients in Zambia. Hira & Patel 1977 describe S. fulleborni as a common intestinal nematode of primates in Africa and Asia. ""Pampiglione and Ricciardi have focused attention on its prevalence in man in Africa...[where, in certain specified areas] its prevalence far exceeds that of S. stercoralis...They have suggested that the parasite is well-adapted to man rather than being a zoonosis."" although later states ""Pampiglione and Ricciardi have shown human infection to be common with this primate species...their investigations...were confined to rural population groups where close ecological association between man and primate hosts would, of course, facilitate transmission."" however, their (still Hira & Patel) study finds that ""S. fulleborni far from being a parasite confined to the rural population is readily transmissable in an urban/suburban environment even in the absence of the normal definitive host."" So clearly found in humans and possibly zoonotic transmission via environmental contamination? Low confidence because can't access that article.  But also clearly S. fulleborni transmission sans zoonotic transmission. In the conclusion of Hira & Patel 1977: ""Whether S. fulleborni is an accidental parasite or a species well adapted for interhuman transmission has been queried [cites Pampiglione and Ricciardi 1971]. Most of the cases recorded here were form an urban and suburban area where primates are rare...Thus, interhuman transmission is undoubtedly a feature.  It would be fair to state also that we have recetly investigated a farmer who harbored the parasite. He was referred from a rural district hospital and related at length that baboons were a constant menace raiding his crop. Thus there is clear evidence that infection may be transmitted via primates also."" Hasegawa et al. 2010: ""Humans infected with S. fuelleborni have been reported from Africa, and New Guinea. In Africa, interhuman transmission has been considered, but transmission via primates has also been suggested [cites Hira & Patel 1977)"" (most internal citations omitted)  Acha, vol 2, pg 280+ states that the reservoirs for S. fuelleborni are African and Asian simians and the source of infection is primate feces, both nonhuman and human. ""Originally, the infection was zoonotic (from nonhuman to human primates), but there is growing evidence that S. fuelleborni in various parts of Africa is transmitted from human to human."" Acha further discusses transmission in settings where nonhuman primates are rare or in young humans but provides no citation for the statement about zoonotic infection.  Acha also cites Hira & Patel 1980 (no access to full article) to say that 34% of 76 infants under 200 days old were infected with S. fulleborni, suggesting vertical transmission.  Later states ""Strongyloidiasis caused by S. fuelleborni is an infection of both zoonotic and inter-human transmission"" - I tend to agree, but with low confidence because no one has given me a good citation. Brown and Girardeau 1977: Studied possible transmammary passage of S. fulleborni in humans and found evidence to suggest it is occuring. Such passage has been found in non-human primates. Strongyloides larvae were found in a sample of breast milk in ""Zaire,"" and morphologically, the larvae were most likely S. fulleborni.  Torn between confidence score of 3 and 2.

Talking about the potentially fatal human strongyloidiases discovered in New Guinea, which has been attributed to Strongyloides fuelleborni kelleyi ""The sequences determined from S. papillosus and S. f. kelleyi were identical, suggesting that human infections arose from S. papillosus, which parasitises a wide range of domesticated animals...If human strongyloidiasis is derived from S. papillosus then the parasites must have been transferred from domesticated animals to New Guinea humans less than 5,000 years ago, around the time these animals were brought to New Guinea""  So that implies that S. papillosus may be able to spill over into humans, although no known current transmission between humans and non-humans.  In fact, I can't find any evidence of S. papillosus in humans.  Streit 2008: S. papillosus (originally called Trichosoma papillosum) first isolated from the small intestine of sheep [Wedl 1856].  Generalized life cycle of Strongyloides spp (more than 50 of which have been found to parasitize a range of vertebrates, mostly mammals): adult parthenogenetic females parasitize the small intestine of a host, prouducing embryos (enclosed in eggshell).  Embryo or early larvae or a mixture exit the host in the feces and develop in the environment.  Go through various larval stages followed by reproducing adult stage.  Early larvae in the environment may develop into infective third-stage larvae and percutaneously invade the host, followed by migration via the circulatory and respiratory systems to develop further and ultimately establish as adult females in the small intestine.  Otherwise, larvae can develop into morphologically distinct, non-infective third-stage larcae which develop into free-living fourth-stage larvae and the finally adult nematodes.  Usually the progeny of the free living adults develop into infective third-stage larvae and must find a host in which to continue the life cycle.  Elsewhere in the paper, S. papillosus from sheep was raised in rabbits, which changed developmental routes (proportion of males and free-living females increased, possibly because the transfer of S. papillosus to the atypical host acted as an immunological stressor).  Albertson et al. 1979: S. papillosus eggs from rabbit feces.  Chandrawathani et al. 1998: S. papillosus is a ubiquitous gastrointestinal parasite of young ruminants, being of particular importance in the tropical/sub-tropical regions of the world.  This nematode parasite is unique in having the ability to reproduce in the external environment as well as in the parasitic stage within the small intestine of the host (Pasha's note: I don't think this is unique--other Strongyloides spp. do this too, I think).  Parasitic stage consists of only adult female worms.  Larvae are passed out in feces which develop either into an infective stage or into free-living male and female worms, which can produce infective larvae.  These can infect the ruminant via skin penetration or by ingestion.  Infective larvae have no protective sheath and have little resistance to desiccation.  HOwever, under warm, moist conditions they can build up to massive numbers in the environment.  Can cause clinical disease and mortality of young ruminants--occurs regularly in Malaysia.  Can't access Tomita 1940, but it seems to be an attempt at experimental infection of S. fulleborni and S. papillosus.  S. papillosus was not found to be infective in humans in this study (from the abstract)",0,Strongyloides papillosus      ,3640,Strongyloides papillosus      ,5,,"Chandrawathani et al., 1998",,VR,42626,,Streit 2008,Chandrawathani et al. 1998,1

Strongyloides stercoralis ,,0,,yes,,2,1,,VR,42626,2,2,"In GIDEON.  First described in stool of French soldiers serving in Vietnam in 1876.  S. stercoralis is found in almost all countries and has been found in a captive orangutan in Indonesia and in baboons in Nigeria.  In Iran, S. stercoralis infection detected in 0.3% of HIV positive patients tested (2 people), both of whom had severe hyperinfection and advanced AIDS.  18.9% of people on Pemba Island (Tanzania) infected by S. stercoralis.  In Malaysia, S. stercoralis has been identified in water samples used to wash produce.  Mafuyai et al. 2013: S. stercoralis found in three baboons in Yankari National Park, Nigeria.  No transmission described, but Mafuyai et al. say that this implicates baboons as a potential source and reservoir for human zoonotic parasitic infection, although not real discussion. Meamar et al. 2007: S. stercoralis hyperinfection in HIV positive patients in Iran.  Dormant or carrier state of Strongyloides may persist for very long periods of time without development of clinical disease.  human strongyloides is endemic in the tropics. Pampiglione et al. 1987 (Italian article, abstract only) 18.9% of human fecal samples infected with Strongyloides stercoralis in Zanzibar.  Bailey et al. 2006: After 6 weeks in Sierra Leone, 9% of british soldiers surveyed had S. stercoralis in feces.  No discussion on how it was acquired.  Zeehaida et al. 2011: S. stercoralis larvae found in water samples used to wash herbs/veggies in Malaysia, with numerous live S. stercoralis larvae observed on the vegetables and herbs.  Larvae probably originated from the free-living life cycle of S. stercoralis in the humid areas which were used to cultivate these vegetables and herbs...S. stercoralis likely infects tens of millions of people worldwide, and is often considered a disease of tropical and subtropical areas.  Most individuals are asymptomatic.  Low socioeconomic status, alcoholism, being male, and farming and coal mining can increase risk for acquiring Strongyloides infection.  Study (Yori et al. 2006, cited here) found that 8.7% of stool samples positive for S. stercoralis and 72.0%  seropositivity in Peruvian Amazon.  Similarly high (11% in stool, 45% seropositivity) in Thailand.  S. stercoralis found in 7.1% of soil samples in areas of Malaysia (soil transmitted helminth).  seems like maybe non-human vertebrates could be a source of environmental contamination (will keep looking), but not necessarily needed for transmission?  Siddiqui and Berk 2001: S. stercoralis infects 30 million people in 70 countries.  Infection usually results in asymptomatic chronic disease of the gut.  Good description of life cycle.  Article by Singh 2002 ""Human strongyloidiasis in AIDS era: its zoonotic importance"" but I don't have access, gahhhh.  Dillard et al. 2007 describe Strongyloides stercoralis as a parasite of dogs, cats, and primates.  They describe cases of S. stercoralis in dogs in a kennel in Finland.  S. stercoralis can be transmitted vertically in dogs via milk (mentioned here, but Shoop et al. 2002 confirms).  Has also been found in arctic foxes in Greenland.  Hmm, I can find no evidence of zoonotic transmission, though.  Scoring this a 2-2 (medium confidence because I read a bunch of articles, but also suspect that in some cases, animals could be a source of environmental contamination, even if they aren't necessary for the transmission)",0,Strongyloides stercoralis      ,21600,Strongyloides stercoralis      ,20,,Siddiqui and Berk 2001,,VR,42626,,Zeehaida et al. 2011,Siddiqui and Berk 2001,1

Yersinia frederiksenii ,,0,,1,3,1,3,,VR,42562,2,2,"GIDEON: Found in fresh water and associated with wound and respiratory infections.  Sulakvelidze 2000 (review article): Y. frederiksenii and other ""Y. enterocolitica-like bacteria"" have not yet been clearly demonstrated to cause human disease.  What has traditionally been called Y. fredericksenii may be multiple species which are difficult to identify (citing other work).  ""Y. frederiksenii has been isolated primarily from fresh water or sewage, soil, fish, wild rodents, foods (milk, sandwiches, fruits, and vegetables), domestic animals (cattle, pigs, etc.), and healthy and sick humans.""  Citing a study in South Bavaria from 1982-1983, 23 Y. frederiksenii strains were identified in central and decetralized water supplies.  Y. frederiksenii can remain viable in sterile water at 4-6 degrees C for up to 2 years.  36% of samples collected from dogs in a kennel were positive for Yersinia spp, of which 11% were Y. frederiksenii...Mice living in the wild are an important reservoir of Y. enterocolitica-like species...citing Shayegani et al. 1986, Y. frederiksenii found in fecal samples from animals.  Will check out that article promptly.  Study from Brazil (Falcao 1991) found isolated Y. frederiksenii from animal food products and lettuce.  Another study (Fukushima & Gomyoda 1986) isolated it from raw milk.  Fukushima et al. 1987 (abstract only) found Y. fresderiksenii strains in beef, pork, and chicken from grocery stores.  Fletcher et al. 1988 found Y. frederiksenii strains associated with diarrheal disease in humans.  Seems like humans can get Y. frederiksenii from the environment but also from animal food products.  Not entirely sure when contamination would have occured.  In NY State, Shayegani et al. 1986 found Y. frederiksenii in fecal samples from gray fox, red fox, goose, and ruffed grouse, but a potential role for these animals as a natural reservoir could not be established as no human infections were reported during that time.
